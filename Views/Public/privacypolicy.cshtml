        <p>
            Welcome to www.traderkerala.com here this Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you

            When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are
            installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the
            individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the
            Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected
            information as “Device Information.”

            We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
